# Initial Setup Conversation

## SSH Key Configuration Issue
User reported issues with SSH key password prompts. Solution implemented:
1. Created setup-git-environment.sh for SSH/Git configuration
2. Implemented systemd-based SSH agent persistence
3. Added keychain for SSH key management

## Repository Creation
Created two scripts:
1. setup-git-environment.sh:
   - Configures SSH agent
   - Sets up Git global config
   - Installs GitHub CLI
   - Manages SSH keys

2. create-repositories.sh:
   - Creates all required repositories
   - Sets up initial README files
   - Organizes repository structure

## Script Improvements
Separated concerns between scripts:
- Moved all Git/SSH configuration to setup-git-environment.sh
- Simplified create-repositories.sh to focus on repository management
