# Mega Solution Platform Project Overview

## Project Context
The project aims to build a comprehensive enterprise platform with multiple components and services. Based on the documentation reviewed, it includes:

1. Core Platform Components (mega-solution-platform)
   - UI Component Library
   - Core Business Logic
   - API Client Libraries
   - Authentication Package
   - Shared Utilities

2. Microservices
   - Authentication Service
   - Communications Service
   - Projects Service
   - HR Service
   - Finance Service

3. Infrastructure and DevOps
   - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
   - Kubernetes Configurations
   - CI/CD Pipelines
   - Monitoring and Logging

## Repository Structure
Organization: horus-tatweer

### Repositories:
1. mega-solution-platform (Monorepo)
2. mega-service-auth
3. mega-service-communications
4. mega-service-projects
5. mega-service-hr
6. mega-service-finance
7. mega-infrastructure
8. mega-docs
9. mega-devops

## Current Status
1. Created GitHub organization "horus-tatweer"
2. Created setup scripts:
   - setup-git-environment.sh (Git/SSH configuration)
   - create-repositories.sh (Repository creation)

## Next Steps
1. Verify all repositories are created correctly
2. Set up base structure for each repository
3. Implement core UI components
4. Set up infrastructure templates
5. Begin microservices development

## Issues/Concerns to Address
1. SSH key persistence needs verification
2. Repository access controls need to be set up
3. Development environment standardization needed
4. CI/CD pipeline setup pending

## Technical Decisions
1. Using systemd for SSH agent management
2. Monorepo approach for core platform
3. Separate repositories for microservices
4. GitHub CLI for repository management
